# Micro-Qubic

A pay-per-use micro-payments engine built for the Qubic ecosystem. Full-stack web app with a Python Flask backend and a modern frontend.

## About the Project

Micro-Qubic is a micro-payments platform that lets merchants turn digital services—APIs, tools, content, compute—into billable resources priced in QUBIC. Micropayments are small, high-frequency payments that avoid subscription lock-in: users pay only for what they consume, with low per-transaction cost and near-instant settlement. The stack runs on the Qubic blockchain: a decentralized, quorum-based consensus network designed for high throughput, low latency, and minimal fees, with native support for deterministic smart contracts and scalable transaction finality. This project provides end-to-end monetization infrastructure: merchants get API keys and create resources with fixed micro-prices; users initiate payment sessions tied to a resource and a wallet; sessions move from pending to paid upon confirmation, and merchants can track revenue and grant access programmatically. The value is clear: developers and creators monetize digital assets without gatekeeping or minimums; end-users get fair, usage-based pricing instead of flat subscriptions; and the whole flow is built for the Qubic ecosystem’s cost and speed profile.
